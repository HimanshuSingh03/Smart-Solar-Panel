# Smart-Solar-Panel
Solar panel capable of tracking a light source while displaying incoming power data  such as mW, mA, V, and panel temperature. The system was controllable via app. 
The project was a miniature model of a design that could be mounted on the top of highrise buildings to collect incoming sunlight from surrounding building reflections.
